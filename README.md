### What I learned

This was my first time working with Promises and the Fetch API, and while it was challenging at times, I feel like I have a better understanding of these concepts now. 

I was stuck for awhile because I didn't understand how to access the response object. However, after reviewing the documentation and a couple articles, I realized that I could chain .then() to my fetch response and that would give me access to the actual data returned from fetch(). 

### Useful resources
